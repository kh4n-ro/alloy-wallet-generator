# alloy-wallet-generator
Alloy offline wallet generator

This page generates a new Alloy XAO address. It is self contained and does all the necessary calculations locally, so is suitable for generating a new wallet on a machine that is not connected to the network, and may even never be. This way, you can create an Alloy wallet without risking the keys.
